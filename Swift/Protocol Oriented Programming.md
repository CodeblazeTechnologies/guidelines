# Protocol Oriented Programming


### What's a Protocol?
> As per Apple's The Swift Programming Language (Swift 4.0.3)

A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol.
